    "In this lab, we'll make use of everything we've learned about pandas, data cleaning, and Exploratory Data Analysis. In order to complete this lab, you'll have to make import, clean, combine, reshape, and visualize data to answer questions provided, as well as your own questions!\n",

    "## Goals\n",
    "* Use all available pandas knowledge to clean the dataset and deal with null values\n",
